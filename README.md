# Python-Challenge
This is the the repository for the Python Challenges!

The PyBank folder contains the analysis for the banking data and the PyPoll folder contains the analysis for the election data.

Both folders contain a main python script that runs the analysis along with a resources and analysis folder. The resources folder contains the CSV file on which the analysis occurs and the analysis folder contains the final text file output of the python script.
